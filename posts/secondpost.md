# Getting a little bit of the Nitty Gritty
## Some actual code

### What did we do?
We worked on enhancing and implementing some of the features we needed to have an MVP. This included getting a real-time clock, weather, and the recently closed tabs. After we got the functionality we moved towards a little bit of the layout and design and also gathering content to display on our About Us page. (images to be added soon)

### How did it go?

The first day was mostly planning for the week. Like I mentioned above it was a lot improving and implementing the research and content that we gathered from the previous sprints.

There were definitely a lot of speed bumps with getting the scripts for the weather and time to talk with the browser. For me, this meant first getting the script to run within the HTML file and learning how to import libraries in html files. Then after it was abstracting that out of the html and into an separate JS file.

At the end of the week, we were scrambling to make sure that all of our branches and code were up to date to make sure it was cohesive and ran smoothly to present through our localhost. The presentation itself was smooth overall but the ending can be a bit smoother. It was fairly short and to the point. The demo generated a lot of good feedback and improvements we can watch out for so we will be implementing that the next coming week.
