# Finding Our Flow
## Adjusting to team project life and pacing

### Introduction
I guess a first post should come with a little introduction. My name is Dean. I'm training to become a Full Stack Engineer and Web Developer and the purpose of this blog is to keep track of how the project, Flow, is going. Not sure what else to add into this intro but as I make more of these posts I'll get more comfortable with it I promise.

So this post will seem a little out of context because we are on our second week of working on it but I'll give a bit of context now and maybe provide more in a later post.

Flow is intended to be a homepage alternative to the default Google homepage. From hardcore work mode, youtube binging and anything in between, I would like it to help smoothen out the task of navigating the internet in any sort of train of thought a user might have. The idea came to me as most of my ideas do, spontaneously while distracted from other things I should be doing. Now I find myself working towards seeing it through so that's pretty cool.

### Project Update
Okay, update time. This week was a some more planning and logistics. For me this involved figuring out a good pace to keep the sprint at and assigning task to make sure everyone on the team kept busy but not overwhelmed. The start of the week in particular was a bit of a rough patch for me because I never really was the head of a project of this type. I think I sometimes come off as unsure about the direction of this project and all of the moving parts it can involve so I definitely need to adjust a little bit. But I think a lot of the things I learned when directing a dance team can be applied generally to other projects. A lot of this involves a little bit more pre-planning, gauging how my team and I feel, and remaining flexible to any unforseen hurdles or changes.

Other than figuring out pacing, I did research into exploring some of APIs we would need to implement planned features for our MVP. On the logistical side, I organized and cleaned up the issues, KanBan board, and Github for the project. I also set up the presentation for the week. I think in the name of consistency, I would find extra time to design a theme on Figma just to keep it nice and uniform across the weeks. It will also allow us to keep a consistent branding as well.

I think the team is meshing relatively well. There are times when there's some opinionated clashes but they do get resolved and we are able to move forward. There definitely and experience/knowledge gap among the team (with me being on the lower end #impostersyndrome) But I think it will be ok. I realize what I don't know and hopefully I can stay consistent in learning them.

Overall, I'm pretty excited to see this product through(shoutout to Andre for convincing me to send in my pitch). Cody made a pretty impressive breakthrough when we ran into a hurdle that might have stopped us from having our kiler feature. It's an interesting feeling knowing an idea I pitched could be brought to life and might even be used by people. Its potential to be expanded upon and improved also makes me want to consider upkeep and longevity of the app but I don't think I should get too ahead of myself and take the product one sprint at a time.
